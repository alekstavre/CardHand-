Implement aCardHandclass that supports a person arranging a group of cardsin his or her hand.  The simulator should represent the sequence of cards usinga single positional list ADT so that cards of the same suit are kept together. Im-plement this strategy by means of four “fingers” into the hand, one for each ofthe suits of hearts, clubs, spades, and diamonds, so that adding a new card to theperson’s hand or playing a correct card from the hand can be done in constanttime. The class should support the following methods:•addCard(r,s): Add a new card with rankrand suitsto the hand.•play(s): Remove and return a card of suitsfrom the player’s hand; if thereis no card of suits, then remove and return an arbitrary card from the hand.•iterator(): Return an iterator for all cards currently in the hand.•suitIterator(s): Return an iterator for all cards of suitsthat are currently inthe hand.
